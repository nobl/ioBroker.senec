### 1.6.8 (NoBl)
* Added switch control.ForceLoadBattery to start/stop charging battery. Use this to start/stop forced charging (like with dynamic power prices, ...).

### 1.6.7 (NoBl)
* Added option to turn off local polling.

### 1.6.6 (NoBl)
* Node 16 required
* Bugfixes
* Removed non-existing branches: _calc, Bat1Obj[2-4], Display, Statistic, File

### 1.6.1 (NoBl)
* Bugfixes

### 1.6.0 (NoBl)
* Added option to also poll SENEC App API. This requires user credentials for mein-senec.de
* We are starting with just some information - more to follow. But with Dashboard we at least have current values and day statistics back.

### 1.5.1 (NoBl)
* Added more datapoints. If you experience messages in log - feel free to add them yourself to state_attr on github (pull request)
* Autarky calculations will stopp working because SENEC removed STATISTICS branch.
* If you experience issues with connecting to your appliance after it got updated, please activate https connection in settings.

### 1.5.0 (NoBl)
* Added configuration section to add datapoints to high priority polling. Please be aware of the possible issues this could cause (if too many datapoints added) and use at your own risk.
* ALL Wallbox datapoints have been removed from high priority polling. Only some users even have a SENEC wallbox. Please reconfigure via the new config dialogue.
* Possible Candidate for stable. Please report any findings!

### 1.4.3 (NoBl)
* Working on https connection. Please test and report!

### 1.4.2 (NoBl)
* Added option to use https for connecting to SENEC (only activate if your appliance supports / requires this!)

### 1.4.1 (NoBl)
* Fix: Autarky calculations are working again.

### 1.4.0 (NoBl)
* Added object caching along with some minor code updates. Due to the amount of objects we deal with caching is about mandatory.

* Added more state definitions

### 1.3.8 (NoBl)
* Removed (unnecessary) admin tab

### 1.3.7 (NoBl, noffycws, git-ZeR0)
* Updates to state translations (new values when SENEC turned off appliances)
* Added state definitions
* Added high priority datapoints: temperatures, voltages, ... to better monitor safety relevant data

### 1.3.6 (NoBl)

* Added more state attributes (if you have updated descriptions or anything, please open an issue!)

### 1.3.3 (NoBl)
* Updated to current template.

### 1.3.2 (NoBl)
* Autarky without decimal places (again). They are causing more updates than we really need.
* Autarky values won't reset to 0 at change of timeframe (day, week, ...) anymore. They are calculated based on reference values anyways.
* Ensuring that only values meant to be changeable by user are defined so (attribute changes upon the next update of value)

### 1.3.1 (NoBl) 20210513
* Added calculation of autarky for day/week/month/year

### 1.3.0 (NoBl) 20210509
* Rewrote translations handling
* Added translations for wallbox status.
* Translated status get an extra datapoint with _Text as postfix. Former translations that didn't add an extra dp will now revert to their numeric representation and add the _Text DP.
* Translations are now handled via lib/state_trans.js for all 3 languages available in the senec system (german, english, italian).
* Language used is decided by the language of the SENEC appliance.

### 1.2.0 (NoBl)
* Added datapoints for: PM1OBJ1, PM1OBJ2, EG_CONTROL, RTC, PM1, TEMPMEASURE, DEBUG, SOCKETS, CASC, WALLBOX, CONNX50, STECA (please report wrong / missing units).
* Adapter now calculates day/week/month/year-values for: STATISTIC.LIVE_GRID_EXPORT, STATISTIC.LIVE_GRID_IMPORT, STATISTIC.LIVE_HOUSE_CONS, STATISTIC.LIVE_PV_GEN, STATISTIC.LIVE_BAT_CHARGE_MASTER, STATISTIC.LIVE_BAT_DISCHARGE_MASTER. Calculated values can be found below the "_calc." datapoint. Information about daily values was removed from the API by SENEC in the past. So here we go again ...

### 1.1.1 (NoBl)
* Object attributes are updated to what they are expected to be: unit, description, datatype (this will break anything that still relies on datapoints being STRING that aren't meant to be string)

### 1.1.0 (NoBl)
* Updated to current adapter template
* Integrated GitHub Testing and auto npm publishing
* Some other administrative updates

### 1.0.13 (NoBl)

### 1.0.10 (NoBl, smartpran)
* DateType objects are stored as date again
* changed WIZARD.SETUP_POWER_RULE unit to '%'
* changed name of STATISTIC.STAT_SUM_E_PU to "STAT_SUM Energy PowerUnit"

* Bugfix in creating debug data
* Unknown states are now reported in debug instead of info.
* Code cleanup

### 1.0.7 (NoBl)
* Reading all known states from SENEC.
* Split states into high/low priority (heavy requesting the SENEC system renders it unable to sync with the SENEC datacenter!).
* Updated adapter-core and testing versions along with current dev dependencies. Removed node 8 support.
* Added more state descriptions to manual. But need input on these and those that are still not documented.
