## senec adapter for ioBroker

[Dokumentation DE](docs/de/README.md)<br>
[Documentation EN](docs/en/README.md)

Initially targeted at the Senec Home V2.1 System.
In the Senec.Home system, only selected values can be changed by the adapter. Use of this functionality is at your own risk and must be activated manually in the configuration beforehand.
Senec currently also no longer provides a reliable way to influence peak shaving via the web interface. For this purpose, mein-senec.de must be used.
Whether other systems (e.g. V3) also work with it depends on whether they are also based on lala.cgi and provide the same JSON information.
Even with integration into the Senec.Clound it is not guaranteed that the data can still be retrieved via the web interface (for this please report your experiences).

Systems that might work:
* Senec Home 4.0 / Blei
* Senec Home 6.0 Pb
* Senec Home 8.0 / Blei
* Senec Home 10.0 Pb
* Senec Home 5.0/7.5/10.0 / Lithium
* Senec Home 15.0 / Lithium
* Senec Home V2 5.0/7.5/10.0
* Senec Home V2 10.0 / Blei
* Senec Home V2.1 1ph / Lithium
* Senec.Home V3 Hybrid
* Senec.Home V3 Hybrid duo
* Senec Business 30.0 / Blei
* Senec Business V2 30.0 / Blei
* Senec Business 25.0 / Lithium
* Senec Business V2_2ph / Lithium
* Senec Business V2 3ph / Lithium
* ADS Tec
* OEM LG
* Solarinvert Storage 10.0 / Blei

SENEC Systems that don't provide a local webinterface might be monitored by using the API functionality only. Please contact the developer if you have any input on this.

## Installation
You can install the adapter via the ioBroker web interface.

1. Open your ioBroker web interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.178.42:8081)
2. Click on Tab "Adapters"
3. Type "senec" in the filter
4. Click on the  "+" symbol of the senec adapter

## Setup
In addition to the adapter installation you have to add an instance of the adapter.

### ioBroker 
1. Open your ioBroker interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.178.42:8081) (if configuration dialogue was opened automatically after installation, skip to 4.).
2. Navigate to Tab "Instances"
3. Click on the wrench symbol of the senec adapter
4. Now you can see the main settings of the adapter configuration page.<br>
![Main Settings](/docs/en/media/mainSettings.png)
4.1 Type in the IP-address of your SENEC system (FQDN is also possible if you have a working local DNS).<br>
4.2 You can change the polling interval, too. (Default: 10 seconds for high priority data, 60 minutes for low priority data)<br>
Warning! If you are polling too often, your SENEC system will not be able to connect to the SENEC servers anymore! So please be aware of this!<br>
4.3 If your network requires a higher timeout for requests sent to SENEC, please change the Request-Timeout in miliseconds accordingly. (Default: 5000 miliseconds)<br>
4.4 In case there is an issue communicating with SENEC the adapter will retry several times. You can adjust how often it will try to read from SENEC. (Default: 10)<br>
4.5 To space retries apart a bit more you can adjust the Polling Retry Factor. (Default: 2)<br>
Example: Using default settings the 1st retry will happen 20 seconds after the initial try, the 2nd will happen 40 seconds after the 2nd try.<br>
After each successful connect to SENEC, the number of retries is reset.
5. Click on Save & Close

### 1.6.10 (NoBl)
* Bugfix for AllTimeHistory (should work again)

### 1.6.9 (NoBl)
* Added switch in config to enable active control of appliance (you will need activate this, if you want to control the appliance via the adapter)
* Improved handling of forced loading (please report if we need more appliance-states covered by this)
* Minor improvements and bugfixes

### 1.6.8 (NoBl)
* Added switch control.ForceLoadBattery to start/stop charging battery. Use this to start/stop forced charging (like with dynamic power prices, ...).

### 1.6.7 (NoBl)
* Added option to turn off local polling.

### 1.6.6 (NoBl)
* Node 16 required
* Bugfixes
* Removed non-existing branches: _calc, Bat1Obj[2-4], Display, Statistic, File

### 1.6.5 (NoBl)
* Added AllTime Statistics (trigger initial calculations in adapter settings)
* https is now default for new instances

### 1.6.4 (NoBl)
* Bugfix (numbers are numbers again)
