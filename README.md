## Installation
You can install the adapter via the ioBroker web interface.

1. Open your ioBroker web interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.178.42:8081)
2. Click on Tab "Adapters"
3. Type "senec" in the filter
4. Click on the  "+" symbol of the senec adapter

## Setup
In addition to the adapter installation you have to add an instance of the adapter.

### ioBroker 
1. Open your ioBroker interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.178.42:8081) (if configuration dialogue was opened automatically after installation, skip to 4.).
2. Navigate to Tab "Instances"
3. Click on the wrench symbol of the senec adapter
4. Now you can see the main settings of the adapter configuration page.<br>
![Main Settings](/docs/en/media/mainSettings.png)
4.1 Type in the IP-address of your SENEC system (FQDN is also possible if you have a working local DNS).<br>
4.2 You can change the polling interval, too. (Default: 10 seconds for high priority data, 60 minutes for low priority data)<br>
Warning! If you are polling too often, your SENEC system will not be able to connect to the SENEC servers anymore! So please be aware of this!<br>
4.3 If your network requires a higher timeout for requests sent to SENEC, please change the Request-Timeout in miliseconds accordingly. (Default: 5000 miliseconds)<br>
4.4 In case there is an issue communicating with SENEC the adapter will retry several times. You can adjust how often it will try to read from SENEC. (Default: 10)<br>
4.5 To space retries apart a bit more you can adjust the Polling Retry Factor. (Default: 2)<br>
Example: Using default settings the 1st retry will happen 20 seconds after the initial try, the 2nd will happen 40 seconds after the 2nd try.<br>
After each successful connect to SENEC, the number of retries is reset.
5. Click on Save & Close

## Changelog
### 1.6.0 (NoBl)
* Added option to also poll SENEC App API. This requires user credentials for mein-senec.de
* We are starting with just some information - more to follow. But with Dashboard we at least have current values and day statistics back.

### 1.5.1 (NoBl)
* Added more datapoints. If you experience messages in log - feel free to add them yourself to state_attr on github (pull request)
* Autarky calculations will stopp working because SENEC removed STATISTICS branch.
* If you experience issues with connecting to your appliance after it got updated, please activate https connection in settings.

### 1.5.0 (NoBl)
* Added configuration section to add datapoints to high priority polling. Please be aware of the possible issues this could cause (if too many datapoints added) and use at your own risk.
* ALL Wallbox datapoints have been removed from high priority polling. Only some users even have a SENEC wallbox. Please reconfigure via the new config dialogue.
* Possible Candidate for stable. Please report any findings!

### 1.4.3 (NoBl)
* Working on https connection. Please test and report!

### 1.4.2 (NoBl)
* Added option to use https for connecting to SENEC (only activate if your appliance supports / requires this!)

### 1.4.1 (NoBl)
* Fix: Autarky calculations are working again.

### 1.4.0 (NoBl)
* Added object caching along with some minor code updates. Due to the amount of objects we deal with caching is about mandatory.

### 1.3.10 (NoBl)
* Fixed wrong Unit for STATISTIC.LIVE_WB_ENERGY
* Updated to json Admin UI
* Technical Updates
* Added more state_attr definitions

### [Former Updates](CHANGELOG_old.md)
